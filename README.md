Hairy Dubstep
=============

We are Mousseto and Gaeel. We are awesome and we are making a game for this Ludum Dare, because of the aforementioned awesomness.




Captain's log
-------------

+ Step One *pre-jam prep*
	+ Theme not yet announced, just creating a new project and making sure we're all ready to rock. (Dude, I was BORN ready)
+ Step Two *Designing the shit out of this game*
	+ Theme is "10 Seconds"
	+ We're making a game about a hostage situation
	+ The situation must be resolved within 10 seconds
	+ You control a squad of SWAT agents
	+ You scrub forwards and backwards in time and give orders
	+ Only a friggin' amazing 10 Seconds will result in a 100% win
